# UUIDOffline
Copies the UUID from the server to the client

This is a very hackish, quick fix for scenarios where the client and the server's interpretation of the player's UUID don't match.

Seems to be only needed on certain offline-mode servers (e.g. where you are playing on a LAN without Internet access).

Use it at your own risk.
